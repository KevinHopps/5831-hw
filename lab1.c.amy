	// This program teaches you about the various ways to "schedule" tasks.
	// You can think of the three blinking LEDs as separate tasks with 
	// strict timing constraints.
	//
	// As you build your program, think about the guarantees that you can 
	// make regarding the meeting of deadlines. Think about how the CPU
	// is "communicating" with the LEDs. Obviously, everything is output,
	// but what if it was input? Also think about how data can be passed
	// among tasks and how conflicts might arise.
	//
	// You will construct this program in pieces.
	// First, establish WCET analysis on a for loop to use for timing.
	// Use the for loop to blink the red LED.
	// Next, set up a system 1 ms software timer, and use that to "schedule" the blink
	// inside a cyclic executive.
	//
	// Blink the yellow LED using a separate timer with a 100ms resolution.
	// Blink the LED inside the ISR.
	//
	// Finally, blink the green LED by toggling the output on a pin using
	// a Compare Match. This is the creation of a PWM signal with a very long period.
